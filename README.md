# About This Repository

This repository is designed to be forked by PhD students when they want to start
writing a new research paper for a conference, journal, or an internal report.

It provides a skeleton set of files and folders in which you can write your own
material, and customise your paper with additional macros.

Each section provides advice as to how to go about writing it. This advice can
be deleted or comment out to make way for your own content.

## Forking the Repository

In the top-right hand corner of the GitHub page for the repository, there should
be a button named "Fork". Click this to fork the repository into your own space.

The new repository will still be called "new-paper", which you will want to
change. To do this, go the "Settings" tab and rename it. Choose a name that is
indicative of the *research content*, rather than the conference venue or
journal. For example, "search-based-testability" is a better name than
"icse2020".

## File Naming and "Coding Standards"

Over time, you will be adding your own files and content to your paper The
various files and examples in this repository show you how to go about doing
that.

Please ensure you stick to the coding standards described. In particular, the
repository opts to use "[kebab-case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase)" for naming
files and directories. All files following the kebab-case convention are
lower-cased, with words separated with hyphens. Using lower-casing and not using
spaces in file and directory names ensures good cross-platform compatibility.
