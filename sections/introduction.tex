\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This section sets the stage for the paper. 
It should clearly explain the problem addressed by the 
paper, and give high level details of your approach
for tackling it, explaining why no other paper already
addresses the exact same problem.

Right before this section concludes, it should always
feature a list of contributions that the paper makes:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Contribution 1. Description.

    \item Contribution 2. Description.

\end{enumerate}    

Try to avoid concluding the introduction with a 
``This paper is organized as follows\ldots'' paragraph,
as they are rarely insightful!

However, you may want to include a sentence or two 
leading into the next section --- Background.
