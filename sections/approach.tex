\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

This section should detail your approach as
clearly as possible, at a high enough level
that the reader can understand. This section
may include a motivating example, explaining
why your approach is needed.

You may want to include some algorithms and
figures to help illustrate the points you
are making, to introduce the motivating
example, or give an overview of the architecture
of your tool.

The information in {\tt figures/plain-figure.tex}
describes how to format a figure, included here as
% Always reference figures like you would reference
% sections as demonstrated in the sections/background.tex
Figure~\ref{fig:plain-figure}.
