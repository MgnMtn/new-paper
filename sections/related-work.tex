\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

This section should cite any work related to your paper, but which is not
integral to the basis of your approach.

It is a useful catch-all for anything that did not appear in background, and
helps satisfy the referees that you know your field by demonstrating a knowledge
of other work that is going on in the area.

While discussing related work, it is important to keep making it clear to the
reader the ways in which each paper is different from your own, and/or addresses
a different problem. In general, it is a mistake to be overly critical of
others' work, unless discussing the limitations of that work helps to draw out
key differences between their approach and yours.
