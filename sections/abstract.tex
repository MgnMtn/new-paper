    The abstract of the paper goes here.
        
    You should, very succinctly, introduce
    the problem and your approach, and give
    an overview of the results of your empirical
    study.

    End with some figures that summarise your 
    results, and which give hard evidence
    of the benefits of your technique.
    
    Note that some conferences and journals
    limit the number of words in an abstract to
    200 or 250.
